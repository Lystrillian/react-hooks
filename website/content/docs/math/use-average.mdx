`useAverage` is a hook that calculates the average of a series of numbers provided as arguments or an array.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useAverage } from '#';
import { useState } from 'react';

const Component = () => {
  const [numbers, setNumbers] = useState([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]);

  const average = useAverage(numbers);

  return <div>Average: {average}</div>;
};
```

## Type Declarations

```typescript
type ValueOrFunction<T> = T | (() => T);

export function useAverage(...args: any[]): number;
```

## API Details

### Parameters

`args`: Can be a series of numbers or an array of numbers. A function returning an array or numbers is also accepted.

### Returns

The average of the provided numbers.

## Common Pitfalls

### Empty Array

When an empty array is provided, it will return `NaN`.

```tsx
const average = useAverage([]);
// Returns NaN due to division by zero.
```
