`useSupported` is a hook that checks if a feature or capability is supported using a callback function.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useSupported } from '#';
import * as React from 'react';

const Component = () => {
  const isLocalStorageSupported = useSupported(() => 'localStorage' in window);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Local Storage Supported: {isLocalStorageSupported ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Component;
```

```tsx
import { useSupported } from '#';
import * as React from 'react';

const Component = () => {
  const isGeolocationSupported = useSupported(() => 'geolocation' in navigator);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Geolocation Supported: {isGeolocationSupported ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Component;
```

## Type Declarations

```ts
export declare function useSupported(callback: SupportCheckCallback): boolean;

export declare type SupportCheckCallback = () => boolean;
```

## Reference

#### useSupported

| Property   | Type            | Description                                               |
| ---------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `callback` | `() => boolean` | A function that checks for feature or capability support. |

### Returns

| Type      | Description                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `boolean` | A boolean indicating whether the feature or capability is supported. |

## Common Pitfalls

### Handling Exceptions

The `useSupported` hook catches any exceptions that may occur during the support check and returns `false` in such cases. It's important to ensure that the callbackf unction doesn't have any unintended side effects.

```tsx
const isSupported = useSupported(() => {
  // Perform support check that may throw an exception
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
});
console.log(isSupported); // Output: false
```

**Solution**: Make sure the callback function only performs the necessary checks and doesn't have any side effects that could throw exceptions.
