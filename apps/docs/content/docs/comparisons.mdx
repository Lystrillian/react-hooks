## Philosophy

I really liked shadcn-ui and their approach and I thought, "What if this kind of approach could be applied to hooks and how we install them?"

The philosophy of the project is based on the following principles:

**1. Lightweight**:

You can simply copy the code you need into your project without increasing dependencies (If you want you can install the package tho).

**2. Flexibility of Use:**

We provide two ways to integrate our hooks:

- Manually copying the code of the desired hook
- Using our CLI to automatically add selected hooks to your project.

**3. Independence from External Dependencies**

Each hook depends only on React, with no additional external libraries or any other imports then React.

**4. TypeSafe:**

All our hooks are strictly typed, which improves the development experience and helps avoid runtime errors.

**5. Developer Freedom:**

You have full control over which hooks to use and how to integrate them into your project.
