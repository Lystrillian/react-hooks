# React Hooks Collection

Welcome to the React Hooks Collection repository! This is a collection of custom React hooks that are designed to simplify and improve your React development experience. These hooks provide reusable and effective solutions to problems and patterns found in React applications.

## Available Hooks

Currently, the following hooks have been implemented and thoroughly tested:

- `useClipboard`: Simplifies clipboard operations, allowing you to easily copy and paste text.
- `useDebounce`: A hook that provides a debounced version of a value, which is updated only after a certain delay.
- `useDebug`: A hook that returns true if the current window URL contains the string `#debug` or if we're in development mode.
- `useDocumentReadyState`: A hook that returns the document ready state, which is useful for detecting when the document is fully loaded.
- `useDocumentTitle`: A hook that sets the document title based on a given string.
- `useIsClient`: A hook that returns true if the current window is a client-side window.
- `useIsTouchDevice`: A hook that returns true if the current window is a touch device.
- `useIsVisible`: A hook that returns true if an element is visible within the viewport.
- `useMediaQuery`: A hook that returns true if a given media query matches the current viewport.

More hooks are currently being developed and will be added to the collection soon. Stay tuned for updates!
